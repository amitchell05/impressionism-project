            <p>It was while she was copying Old Masters in the Louvre that she has seen Félix Bracquemond, who fell in love
                with
                her.
                His friend, the critic Eugène Montrosier, arranged an introduction and from then, she and Félix were
                inseparable.
                They were engaged for two years before they married on 5 August 1869, despite her mother's opposition.
                In 1870, they had their only child, Pierre.
                Because of the scarcity of good medical care during the War of 1870 and the Paris Commune, Bracquemond's
                already
                delicate health deteriorated after her son's birth.
                Much of what is known of Bracquemond's personal life comes from an unpublished short biography authored by
                her
                son, entitled <cite lang="fr">La Vie de Félix et Marie Bracquemond</cite>.
