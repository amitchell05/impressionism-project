        <p>It was while she was copying Old Masters in the Louvre that she has seen Félix Bracquemond, who fell in love
            with
            her.
            His friend, the critic Eugène Montrosier, arranged an introduction and from then, she and Félix were
            inseparable.
            They were engaged for two years before they married on 5 August 1869, despite her mother's opposition.
            In 1870, they had their only child, Pierre.
            Because of the scarcity of good medical care during the War of 1870 and the Paris Commune, Bracquemond's
            already
            delicate health deteriorated after her son's birth.
            Much of what is known of Bracquemond's personal life comes from an unpublished short biography authored by
            her
            son, entitled <i lang="fr">La Vie de Félix et Marie Bracquemond</i>.
