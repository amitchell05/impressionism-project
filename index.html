            <p>Marie Bracquemond (1 December 1840 – 17 January 1916) was a French Impressionist artist, who was
                described
                retrospectively by Henri Focillon in 1928 as one of <i lang="fr">"les trois grandes dames"</i> of <a

                Her frequent omission from books on artists is sometimes attributed to the efforts of her husband, <a

            <h2>Early Life</h2>

            <p>She was born Marie Anne Caroline Quivoron on 1 December 1840 in Argenton-en-Landunvez, near Brest,
                Brittany.
                She did not enjoy the same upbringing or career as the other well-known female Impressionists – <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Cassatt">Cassatt</a>,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berthe_Morisot">Morisot</a>, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Gonzal%C3%A8s">Gonzalès</a>.

                <p>She was the child of an unhappy arranged marriage.
                    Her mother, Aline Hyacinthe Marie Pasquiou, pursue her life with Émile Langlois, and thereafter they
                    led
                    an
                    unsettled existence, moving from Brittany to the Jura, to Switzerland, and to Limousin, before
                    settling
                    in
                    Étampes, south of Paris.
                    She had one sister, Louise, born in 1849 while her family lived near Ussel (department Corrèze in
                    Limousin)
                    in
                    the ancient abbey Notre-Dame de Bonnaigue.
                </p>


                <p>She began lessons in painting in her teens under the instruction of M. Auguste Vassor, "an old
                    painter
                    who
                    now
                    restored paintings and gave lessons to the young women of the town".
                    She progressed to such an extent that in 1857 she submitted a painting of her mother, sister and old
                    teacher
                    posed in the studio to the Salon which was accepted.
                    She was then introduced to the painter <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres">Ingres</a> who advised her
                    and introduced her to two of his students,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flandrin">Flandrin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signol">Signol</a>.
                    As a student in Ingres' private Parisian studio, she wrote that, “The severity of Monsieur Ingres
                    frightened
                    me…
                    because he doubted the courage and perseverance of a woman in the field of painting… He would assign
                    to
                    them
                    only the painting of flowers, of fruits, of still lives, portraits and genre scenes.”
                    The critic Philippe Burty referred to her as "one of the most intelligent pupils in Ingres' studio".

                </p>

                <p>
                    She later left Ingres' studio and began receiving commissions for her work, including one from the
                    court
                    of
                    Empress Eugenie for a painting of Cervantes in prison.
                    This evidently pleased, because she was then asked by the Count de Nieuwerkerke, the
                    director-general of
                    French
                    museums, to make important copies in the Louvre.
